## Creator Website

#### A website designed to try and capture an influencer's statistics using Youtube, Instagram, Tiktok's API.

### Problems

- TikTok did not have a API for developers to use and fetch data
- Instagram had a API however, using thier graph api would need the specific user's autherization and api key which I was not willing to put into the source code
